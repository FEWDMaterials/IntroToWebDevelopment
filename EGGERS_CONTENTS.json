[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) &mdash; we use this to write our programs\n\n2. [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/?) &mdash; we use this to test our programs","idx":1},"guts-of-a-http-request":{"content":"\n## Guts of an HTML Request\n---\n\n### Question\nWhat happens when you type in [http://www.google.com](http://www.google.com) into the web browser?\n\n### Answer\nA **lot** of background tasks get executed.\n\n1. Browser has no idea what `google` is. It begins by looking up your web url in something called the **DNS**: the *Domain Name System*.\n2. The DNS maps to a specific **IP address**, a collection of numbers that works much like your phone number works.\n3. The browser now knows *where* to send a **HTTP request**. It does this.\n4. After a little while, a **response** comes back to the request sent. \n5. The browser parses this response and figures out what to do with this data (ie: should I draw it in the window? does this need to be download? Streamed? etc)\n6. **???**\n7. Profit\n\n### Question\n\nWhere does this response comes from?\n\n### Answer \n\nA little ol' thing called a **server**.\n\nServers are basically computers that have __one__ specific job: listen for requests from computers like yours. \n\nBased on the request, the server determines what to do: \n* should it respond at all? \n* Should it send back an image? \n* A video? \n* A webpage? \n* Etc.\n\n### Question\n\nWhy does it matter even? Why do __we__, aspiring web developers, even care what the server does?\n\n### Answer\n\nThe way a server stores data and responds to requests gives us valuable insight into how we can build websites of our own...in our own machines.\n\n","idx":2},"taking-a-peek-inside-a-server":{"content":"## Looking into the abyss...err, server \n---\n\nAt the end of the day, a server is **just a computer**...kinda like yours, only on steroids.\n\nMore importantly, a website is essentially **just a folder structure that contains a very specific set of files**.\n\nKinda like this:\n\n```html\nmyAwesomeFirstSite (folder)\n    assets (folder)\n        backgroundImage.jpg\n         ...\n         myDashingMug.png\n     styles (folder)\n         reset.css\n         ...\n         main.css\n     javsacript (folder)\n         main.js\n     index.html\n     about.html\n     contact.html\n```\n\nA few notes for you:\n\n1. **myAwesomeFirstSite** is the folder that will contain all the other folders that you need for your site to work\n2. note that our filenames and folder names have **NO spaces or any other funky business**. This is important! Just letters and numbers and underscores allowed! (Dashes are ok too but I recommend staying away from them).\n3. Inside our **myAwesomeFirstSite** folder, we have three other folders\n 1. **assets**: all website images should go here\n 2. **styles**: all your CSS files should go here\n 3. **javascript**: all your js files should go here\n\n\n### Question\n\nHow do we test our websites?\n","idx":3},"__list__":["home","setting-up-your-environment","guts-of-a-http-request","taking-a-peek-inside-a-server"]}
