Browser has no idea what `google` is. It begins by looking up your web url in something called the **DNS**: the *Domain Name System*.\n2. The DNS maps to a specific **IP address**, a collection of numbers that works much like your phone number works.\n3. The browser now knows *where* to send a **HTTP request**. It does this.\n4. After a little while, a **response** comes back to the request sent. \n5. The browser parses this response and figures out what to do with this data (ie: should I draw it in the window? does this need to be download? Streamed? etc)\n6. **???**\n7. Profit\n\n### Question\n\nWhere does this response comes from?\n\n### Answer \n\nA little ol' thing called a **server**.\n\nServers are basically computers that have __one__ specific job: listen for requests from computers like yours. \n\nBased on the request, the server determines what to do: \n* should it respond at all? \n* Should it send back an image? \n* A video? \n* A webpage? \n* Etc.\n\n### Question\n\nWhy does it matter even? Why do __we__, aspiring web developers, even care what the server does?\n\n### Answer\n\nThe way a server stores data and responds to requests gives us valuable insight into how we can build websites of our own...in our own machines.\n\n","idx":2},"taking-a-peek-inside-a-server":{"content":"## Looking into the abyss...err, server \n---\n\nAt the end of the day, a server is **just a computer**...kinda like yours, only on steroids.\n\nMore importantly, a website is essentially **just a folder structure that contains a very specific set of files**.\n\nKinda like this:\n\n```html\nmyAwesomeFirstSite (folder)\n    assets (folder)\n        backgroundImage.jpg\n         ...\n         myDashingMug.png\n     styles (folder)\n         reset.css\n         ...\n         main.css\n     javsacript (folder)\n         main.js\n     index.html\n     about.html\n     contact.html\n```\n\nA few notes for you:\n\n1. **myAwesomeFirstSite** is the folder that will contain all the other folders that you need for your site to work\n2. note that our filenames and folder names have **NO spaces or any other funky business**. This is important! Just letters and numbers and underscores allowed! (Dashes are ok too but I recommend staying away from them).\n3. Inside our **myAwesomeFirstSite** folder, we have three other folders\n 1. **assets**: all website images should go here\n 2. **styles**: all your CSS files should go here\n 3. **javascript**: all your js files should go here\n\n\n### Question\n\nHow do we test our websites?\n","idx":3},"intro-to-html":{"content":"# Bro: do you even HTML?\n---\n\nYour typical HTML file will look like this:\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n <head>\n <!--\n the HEAD section of html does not have any content\n that the user can see\n\n instead, we place things like:\n page title\n external css links\n SEO keywords\n here\n -->\n <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n <title>My First Awesome Site</title>\n </head>\n <body>\n <!--\n\n the BODY section will contain all the tags\n that the user can _SEE_ and _INTERACT_ with\n -->\n </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**`<!doctype html>`**\n\nThis tag tells the browser to read our HTML content as HTML5, the latest and greatest revision of the HTML spec. We MUST include it as the first thing on our .html files. I usually type it as all lower case, but it's common practice to also type as: <!DOCTYPE html>\n\n**`<html>`**\n\nThis is the root tag. Basically, all other tags in your html file must live inside this tag. Note how on the bottom of the code snippet, we have a \"\". This is called closing a tag and we must close all tags that we open (with the exception of a few). If we do not do this, our HTML markup becomes invalid.\n\n**`<head>`**\n\nThis section contains content that does not show the user things. Typically, we would expect to see things such as the page title, external links, and SEO tags here.\n\n**`<body>`**\n\nAll the magic happens here. All the tags the user interacts with should live in this tag.\n\n## Commonly used HTML Tags\n\n```html\n<!--\n the h1 - or heading one - will have the most important text on page \n by the old guard, we should really only have one h1 per page\n -->\n <h1>Hello, Wrold</h1>\n\n <h2>This is a h2</h2>\n\n <h3>This is an h3</h3>\n\n <h4>This is an h4</h4>\n\n <h5>This is an h5</h5>\n\n <h6>This is an h6</h6> \n\n <!--\n this is an inline element\n unline the block element, which is meant to provide structure\n the inline element is interpreted as content\n this means that will appear next to one another\n -->\n <strong>This is an inline element</strong>\n <strong>This is another inline element</strong>\n\n <!-- this is a block element so it will NOT be on the same line -->\n <h1>Will this be on the same line?</h1>\n\n <!-- \n\n differences between block elements and inline elements\n block: takes up entire width of page unless otherwise told \n (we don't know how yet)\n we can impose dimensions on block elements\n inline: meant to be content or text\n we cannot impose dimensions on inline elements \n\n -->\n\n <!-- how to add more spaces or line breaks?? -->\n <h1>THIS will have many &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spaces</h1>\n\n <h1>This is <br> Sparta</h1>\n\n <a href=\"http://www.google.com\">Hello, Wrold I'm a link, yo</a>\n\n <!--\n this is one mode\n <tagName attribute1=\"someValue\" attribute2=\"someOtherValue\"></tagName>\n\n this is a self closing tag\n <tagName attribute1=\"someValue\" attribute2=\"someOtherValue\">\n --> \n\n <!--\n convention: \n external links open up in new tab\n absolute URLs\n\n internal links open up in same tab\n relative URLs\n -->\n\n <a href=\"http://www.google.com\" target=\"_blank\">Hello, Wrold I'm ALSO a link, yo</a>\n\n <em>This is an em</em>\n\n <p>This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.</p>\n\n <img src=\"http://placekitten.com/g/200/300\">\n <span>This is a kitten.

It's a method for searching your HTML tags efficiently and applying visual styles to the results it finds.\n\n### Definitions\n\n**selectors**: a keyword used to query your HTML. Comes in a few flavors:\n\n1. **tag selectors**: search your HTML by tagname\n2. **className selectors**: search your HTML by class attribute\n3. **id selectors**: search your HTML by ID attribute\n\n### PSETs\n\n1.
